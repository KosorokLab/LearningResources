# Learning Resources
Wiki for learning resources on topics of interest curated by lab members. 

# Important Stuff
This is a public repository so that collaborators who aren't part of the Lab's Github team can access it. While aimed at our lab and its collaborators, keep in mind that *anyone* can view the repository.

Don't put pdfs of copyrighted stuff here even if we all have access through the UNC library. Instead put a link to the article or book.

## Wiki Tab 

Everything is in the wiki tab.
